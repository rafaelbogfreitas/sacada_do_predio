## About The Project

The coronavirus pandemic changed the way we function as a society. The social distancing we had to undergo brougth back a sense of community that had been partially lost. Scenes of people gathering in their balconies with their family and neighbours became very common, as well as the problems the communities around the globe started facing due to the pandemic. In face of this situation we decided to create Sacada do Prédio.

Sacada do Prédio is a web application where people can post their needs and other users from their community can help. The idea for the name came from the gatherings in the balconies (Sacada in portuguese). Our balconies are places where we can hang out and connect with people, but they also provide us with a view of our neighbourhood. Why not use it to better understant and help the people of our community?

Our goal is to provide a platform where users can register and post new cases. Whenever a new case is posted, all users within that area are notified so that they can volunteer to help. The users can also see the cases in their community either in a map view or card view.
